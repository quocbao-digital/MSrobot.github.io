          <h5>How to start your learning journey</h5>
          <p>To start your self-learning, you need to learn for free on the internet. Its recommendations are based on a review of the existing academic literature which is complemented by the analysis of numerous contributions by software developers, self-learners, and teachers of programming. Additionally, it incorporates effective learning techniques derived from psychological research. Its intended readers are primarily entrepreneurs and ‘startup people’ who are driven to build new businesses with code, although the proposed approach is also transferable to other domains and audiences.</p>  
          <br>
          <p>The single most important factor for succeeding in learning programming has been found to be of human nature: learner motivation and persistence. While most beginners and the majority of academic contributions focus mostly on technical aspects such as which language to learn first, or which learning resources to use, this paper analyzes the learning process itself. Learning programming is thus divided into three main steps:</p>
          <p><strong>First</strong>, I highlight the importance of setting a strong learning goal for motivation, and provide a big-picture overview of what ‘learning programming’ encompasses to structure the approach.</p>
          <p><strong>Second</strong>, I provide learners with recommendations as to which language to learn first - there is no one ‘best’ choice - as well as how and where to find effective learning resources.</p>
          <p><strong>Lastly</strong>, the paper concludes with tips for optimizing the learning process by introducing effective learning techniques, highlighting the importance of programming practice, and collecting additional advice from programmers and self-learners.</p>

          <h5>How to learn faster in small time</h5>
          <p>
            While it's nice to think you can hack your way to success, whenever you try to accomplish a huge goal -- like starting and growing a business -- skills matter. Who you know is certainly important.
            <br>
            But what you know, and what you can do, matters a whole lot more.
            <br>
            Which means the faster you learn, the more successful you can be.
          </p>
          <p class="five ways">
            So let's jump right in.Here are five ways, backed by science, to speed up the learning process.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>1. Take notes by hand, not on a computer.</strong>
            <br>
            Most of us can type faster than we can write. (And a lot more neatly.)
            But research shows handwriting your notes means you'll learn more. Oddly enough, taking notes by hand enhances both comprehension and retention, possibly because instead of just serving as a quasi-stenographer, you're forced to put things in your own words in order to keep up.
            Which means you'll remember what you heard a lot longer.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>2. Chunk your study sessions.</strong>
            <br>
            <p>You're busy. So you wait until the last minute to learn what you need to know: A presentation, a sales demo, an investor pitch...</p>
            <p>Bad idea. Research shows "distributed practice" is a much more effective way to learn.</p>
            <p>Imagine you want to nail your investor pitch. Once you've drafted your pitch, run through it once. Then take a few minutes to make corrections and revisions.</p>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>3. Test yourself. A lot.</strong>
            <br>
            <p>A number of studies show that self-testing is an extremely effective way to speed up the learning process.</p>
            <p>Partly that's due to the additional context created; if you test yourself and answer incorrectly, not only are you more likely to remember the right answer after you look it up... you'll also remember that you didn't remember. (Getting something wrong is a great way to remember it the next time, especially if you tend to be hard on yourself.)</p>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>4. Change the way you practice.</strong>
            <br>
            <p>A number of studies show that self-testing is an extremely effective way to speed up the learning process.</p>
            <p>Partly that's due to the additional context created; if you test yourself and answer incorrectly, not only are you more likely to remember the right answer after you look it up... you'll also remember that you didn't remember. (Getting something wrong is a great way to remember it the next time, especially if you tend to be hard on yourself.)</p>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>5. Teach someone else.</strong>
            <br>
            <p>A number of studies show that self-testing is an extremely effective way to speed up the learning process.</p>
            <p>Partly that's due to the additional context created; if you test yourself and answer incorrectly, not only are you more likely to remember the right answer after you look it up... you'll also remember that you didn't remember.
